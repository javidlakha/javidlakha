👋 Greetings!

🎓 I'm a masters student in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard, due to graduate in May 2026.

💻 Previously, I was a Research Engineer at [Legatics](https://www.legatics.com/) and [Spherical Defense Labs](https://sphericaldefense.com/).

🔬 I write about interesting machine learning research papers at [blog.javid.io](https://blog.javid.io/).

✉️ My email address is [javidlakha@g.harvard.edu](mailto:javidlakha@g.harvard.edu). I enjoy talking to people about machine learning research - if you do too, please say hi!
